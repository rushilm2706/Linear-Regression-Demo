# Linear-Regression-Code-Demo 

- This notebook will walk you through the code to understand the general concept and application part of linear regression.
- Figure 1 in the jupyter notebook is an example of an ideal data and ideal regression line. This is used to introduce the basic concept of linear regression.
- For the credit dataset we have 'Balance' as the dependent variable and all other columns are independent variables.
- Plotting 'Balance' against 'Income' we can see that we get a scatterplot which is not perfectly linear and in real life we will be given this type of dataset.
- We are using a small cars dataset with 392 rows which has 4 columns: ‘MPG ’: (Miles Per Gallon i.e efficiency of the car, ‘CYL’ : No. of cylinders, ‘ENG’: Engine Block Size(cc) , ‘WGT’ : Weight of the car(lbs).
- We produce a regression line from the data for MPG vs WGT to see the effect of weight on efficiency of the car.
- We plot the errors in the dataset where we found that most of the data points have almost zero error, indicating a good fit.
- Plotting the errors clearly explains the concept of least squares that was explained in the theory class.
- For a better understanding of the concept, we plot the regression line on the dataset to demonstrate how the regression line produced will look.
- The regression line intersects the lines passing through the average MPG and average WGT values respectively.
- We test the model by plugging in some numbers in the regression equation.
- We test for weight = 2000 and 3000. The predicted values come very close to the real values in the dataset.
- Students should now have a better understanding about the general concept of linear regression.
- Students can download this notebook and play around with it for their understanding.
